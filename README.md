# gw-redactify

This project is a React-based UI application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
*   **Node.js**: It is recommended to use the [LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. If you prefer Yarn, you can install it globally: `npm install -g yarn`.
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the `gw-redactify` repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gw-redactify
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned project directory and install the necessary dependencies. If you are using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you are using `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. This will compile the project and open it in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).

If you are using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are using `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### 4. Build for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, which will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` folder, run:

If you are using `npm`, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you are using `yarn`, run:

```bash
yarn build
```
